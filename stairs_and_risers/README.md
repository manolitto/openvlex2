### Clipping Variants

- For parts **without holes on the bottom** side (1/3" risers and platforms): print out [OpenVLex glue jacks](../jacks#openvlex-glue-jacks) and attach (i.e. glue) them to the bottom.

  Hint: Use another part of the same shape as a gluing stencil.

- For parts **with holes on the bottom** side ("openvlex.top\_and\_bottom"): print out some [OpenVLex double jacks](../jacks#openvlex-double-jacks) ("half strong" variant recommended) and use them to clip parts together **without gluing**.
