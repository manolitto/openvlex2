OpenVLex Gluing Stencils

Stencils for easier and more accurately gluing OpenVLex jacks to the bottom of tiles.

### Instructions

As a basic set print one 1x1, one 2x1, and one 2x2 stencil. This should cover 90% of your OpenVLex tiles. Remember that the OpenVLex mission is to prevent the need of exotic tile sizes. However, you may still use the enclosed OpenSCAD file to generate a less common sized stencil.

### Printing Notes

- Material: PLA or PETG
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm
- Layer height: 0.10 mm or 0.15 mm
- Fill Density: 10% to 15%
