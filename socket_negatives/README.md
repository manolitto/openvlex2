# OpenVLex Socket Negatives

## About

With the socket negatives you can remix and kitbash other 3D part (your custom ones or from other sets) to make them
vertically stackable and clipping together with OpenVLex jacks.   

## Remix your own risers, stairs or stackable walls

- use "top socket negatives" for the top surface of risers

- use "bottom socket negatives" for the bottom of parts if you want to make them stackable with double jacks

- use "square/square" negatives for square and rectangular parts

- use "curved/radial" negatives for curved parts

## Instructions

- use the boolean tool of your favorite 3D mesh software to cut out top or bottom socket holes  

- vertically align top socket negatives to the top of your piece

- horizontally center align connector negatives to the inch grid

- for curved/radial sockets there are versions with a plate at z -100 mm which is meant to easier align the sockets to your custom part
