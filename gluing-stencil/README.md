## Instructions

As a basic set, print one 1x1, one 2x1 and one 2x2 stencil. This should cover 90% of your OpenVLex tiles. Remember that the purpose of OpenVLex is to prevent the need for exotic tile sizes.

## Usage

### 4. Use clamps until glue is dry (but not too long)

   > **Note:** Keeping the parts upside down during drying prevents glue from dripping onto the stencil
