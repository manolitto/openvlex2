# OpenVLex 2 Bases



## About

OpenVLex bases can be used as universal bases for all your "wall on tile" terrain pieces. They can be used side by side with all your existing and your "separate wall" OpenForge and OpenLOCK tiles.


### Variants

There are (currently) three OpenVLex base variants:

- magnetic.openlock
- triplex
- triplex (with additional supports)



## Instructions


### Magnetic OpenLOCK Bases

1. Print one lower part and one upper part of your chosen size.

2. Turn the upper part over and insert 5 mm magnetic balls into the round holes of the upper part.

3. Apply (super) glue, but be careful not to soil the magnetic balls.

4. Apply it to the bottom part and press the parts together. I recommend using clamps.


### Triplex Bases

Print and postprocess similar to OpenForge bases.
Use flat-nose pliers to remove the supports. Be careful not to accidentally remove the OpenLOCK bars.

> **Note:** With cheap PLA and/or with some printers it may be necessary to use bases with additional supports. If you see ugly holes on the top, you can either try to adjust your printer configuration to improve bridging (different PLA, hotend temperature, bridging speed, 0.10 mm layer height) or use the bases with additional supports - see below.


### Triplex Bases (with additional supports)

Alternative bases that can be used if you have difficulties with bridging and see holes on the surface of your triplex base.

> **Note:** Be extra careful when removing the supports. There are four support bars per connector opening: Two identical to the standard triplex and two directly behind them deeper inside.

> **Important:** **Do not mistake the supports with the OpenLOCK bars!**
