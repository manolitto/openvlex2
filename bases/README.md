OpenVLex 2 Bases
----------------

OpenVLex bases can be used as universal bases for all your "wall on tile" terrain parts. They can be used side-by-side with all your already existing and your "separate wall" OpenForge and OpenLOCK tiles.

There are (currently) three OpenVLex base variants:

- magnetic.openlock
- triplex
- triplex (with additional supports)

### Instructions

#### Magnetic OpenLOCK Bases

1. Print one lower part and one upper part of your chosen size.
2. Turn over the upper part and put 5mm magnetic balls into the round holes of the upper part.
3. Apply (super) glue but be careful to not soil the magnetic balls.
4. Apply to lower part and press the parts together. I recommend clamps.

#### Triplex Bases

Print and postprocess similar to OpenForge bases.
Use flat pliers to remove the supports. Be careful to not remove the OpenLOCK bars accidently.

Note: With cheap PLA and/or with some printers it might be necessary to use bases with additional supports. If you see some ugly holes on the top surface you may either try to adjust your printer configuration to improve bridging (different PLA, hotend temperature, bridging speed, 0.10mm layer height) or use the bases with additional supports - see below.

#### Triplex Bases (with additional supports)

Alternative bases which can be used if you have difficulties with bridging and see holes on the surface of your triplex base.

Note: Be extra careful when removing the supports. There are four support bars per connector opening: Two identical to standard triplex and two right behind them deeper inside.  
Do not mistake them with the OpenLOCK
